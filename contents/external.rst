External Scripts
################

We're going to use quite a few external/third-party packages in this lab.  These packages manage, amongst other things, how our application **looks**.

Because there's no need for us to write these packages ourselves, we can grab them from their original sources and simply copy them into our app.

Checking directory structure
............................

#. Create the following directories.  Windows users can create new folders using Windows Explorer.

   - **public/css**
   - **public/css/fonts**
   - **public/css/vendor**
   - **public/js**
   - **public/js/vendor**

   Commands to create these folders, if required, are as follows:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir public/css
      mkdir public/css/fonts
      mkdir public/css/vendor
      mkdir public/js
      mkdir public/js/vendor

#. Create the following files.  They can both remain empty for now.  Windows users can create new files using Notepad (remember to save the file type as "All Files").

   - **public/css/ntnx.css**
   - **public/js/ntnx.js**   

Adding packages
...............

#. Download each resources file linked below and extract it into the appropriate directory.

   - `CSS <https://github.com/nutanixdev/lab-assets/blob/master/php-lab-v3/resources/css-vendor.zip?raw=true>`_ - extract to **public/css/vendor**
   - `Javascript <https://github.com/nutanixdev/lab-assets/blob/master/php-lab-v3/resources/js-vendor.zip?raw=true>`_ - extract to **public/js/vendor**
   - `Fonts <https://github.com/nutanixdev/lab-assets/blob/master/php-lab-v3/resources/fonts.zip?raw=true>`_ - extract to **public/css/fonts**

   .. note::
   
      When extracting the ZIP files, ensure they are extracted **directly** to the directories above and not into subdirectories.

   Here is how the app's **public** directory structure should look at the completion of this step:

   .. figure:: images/public_structure.png

Further testing
...............

With these files in place, our application is starting to not only come together, but also starting to look a lot better.

The navigation bar and form elements at the top of the screen are now styled properly with both colours and fonts.

.. figure:: images/styled.png

It's now time to dig deeper into wiring our app into the Nutanix REST APIs.
